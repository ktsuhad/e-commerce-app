# E-commerce Application - React.js with TypeScript

Welcome to our E-commerce Application, a fully functional online shopping platform developed using React.js and TypeScript. This project demonstrates the core features of an e-commerce website, allowing users to browse products, view product details, add items to their cart, proceed to checkout, and even test payment gateway integration. 

## Features

1. **Home Page with Product Listing:** The home page presents users with a list of available products. Users can explore various categories and products at a glance.

2. **Product Detail Page:** Clicking on a product takes users to its detail page, where they can view more information about the product, including its description, price, and other relevant details.

3. **Add to Cart:** Users have the ability to add products to their shopping cart directly from the product detail page. The cart displays the selected items and their quantities.

4. **Checkout:** When ready to purchase, users can proceed to the checkout page. Here, they can review their order, enter personal information, and choose a payment method.

5. **Test Payment Gateway Integration:** The application includes a test payment gateway integration. Users can simulate making a payment for their order, receiving a payment confirmation upon success.
